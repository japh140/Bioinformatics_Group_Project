Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a cardiovascular genetic disease affecting roughly half a billion people worldwide. According to the NHS, in 2021-2022 almost 250,000 adults in England were diagnosed with T2D. Genetic susceptibility to T2D varies across ancestries with some populations experiencing a higher incidence rate. For instance, south Asians develop T2D early in life despite having a normal body mass index (BMI).

This application has been developed by the Bionic Beavers, a group of five MSc Bioinformatics students at Queen Mary University of London.  The purpose of the project is to produce a functioning protype of a web-based tool to examine T2D molecular data in south Asian populations.

The software application is located within GitHub at the following location:
