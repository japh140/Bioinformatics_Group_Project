Objective
Our primary objective is to preprocess and collect genomic data to conduct positive selection statistical analysis across different populations for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). This will help identify genetic variants potentially under selection, contributing to a better understanding of genetic susceptibility to T2D.

Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Downloading the Reference Genome
The first step involves obtaining a reference genome, which includes genomic data for individual chromosomes or multiple chromosomes (1-22). This reference dataset serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis.
2. Acquiring Genomic Data in VCF Format
The genomic data is typically downloaded as a Variant Call Format (VCF) file. This file contains variant information, including Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variants across individuals.
3. Filtering Data by Population
Once the VCF file is acquired, the next step is filtering the data to focus on a specific population of interest. This is done using population codes to extract relevant genetic variants for T2D-associated studies.
4. Inspecting the Data Format and Quality
Before proceeding further, it is crucial to examine the structure of the VCF file to ensure data integrity. Key checks include:
Identifying any missing data points.
Confirming that the population filtering process was correctly applied.
Checking for empty or corrupted files.
5. SNP Filtering Based on Chromosomal Location
When filtering SNPs, chromosomal location should be used rather than relying on Reference SNP cluster IDs (rsIDs). This ensures a more accurate mapping of genetic variants.
However, it is essential to verify that the chromosomal reference file used for filtering T2D population data is derived from the same genome assembly. This guarantees that chromosomal positions remain consistent across datasets.
6. Continuous Quality Checks
Throughout the entire process, continuous validation of the VCF format and data consistency is necessary. This includes:
Checking for missing or incomplete data.
Identifying empty files or incorrect formats.
Ensuring all filtering steps retain the integrity of the dataset.

Conclusion
By following this structured approach, we ensure that the genomic data is well-prepared for positive selection analysis, allowing us to investigate potential evolutionary influences on T2D susceptibility across different populations.
