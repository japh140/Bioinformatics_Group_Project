## Configuration Management (config.py):

Should contain:
Database URI (for connecting to SQLite).
Flask environment (development, production).
Any API keys, secret keys, or configurations you might need for deployment.



## snp_query.py (Blueprint for SNP Query)
Purpose: This blueprint handles SNP queries based on user input. Users can search by SNP ID, genomic coordinates, or gene name to retrieve relevant SNP information.

Routes:
/search_snp – This route handles SNP searches by rsID (e.g., "rs1234").
/search_coordinates – Handles searches by genomic coordinates (e.g., "chr10:100000-101000").
/search_gene – Handles searches by gene name (e.g., "MYGENE").

Views: The view functions will use the database models to query the SNP_Associations and Selection_stats table and fetch results based on the search type.
Query SNPs by rsID, gene name, or genomic coordinates.
Return SNP name, position, p-value, mapped gene, and selection statistics.
Handle cases where no results are found.


## gene_info.py (Blueprint for Gene Information)
Purpose: Displays information about genes related to the SNPs. This blueprint handles detailed gene information like gene ontology (GO) terms and biological pathways associated with a gene.

Routes:
/gene_info/<gene_name> – Displays detailed gene-related information for a given gene (e.g., GO terms, biological pathways).

Views: This route will query gene-related data from the gene_annotations database, and display GO terms or pathway data.


## download.py (Blueprint for Download Functionality)
Purpose: Handles the downloading of SNP selection statistics and summary statistics in CSV/TSV formats.

Routes:
/download/selection_stats – Provides a CSV/TSV download of selection statistics for SNPs.
/download/summary_stats – Provides a CSV/TSV download for summary statistics (e.g., mean, stdev).

Views:
Generate the requested data file (CSV or TSV) and serve it to the user as a downloadable file.


## population.py (Blueprint for Population-Based Visualizations)
Purpose: Handles visualizations and descriptive information for different populations (geography, sample size, etc.), and displays plots of positive selection statistics.

Routes:
/population_visualization – A route to select a population and view its selection statistics across SNPs.
/population_info/<population> – Displays descriptive information about the selected population (e.g., geography, sampling locations).

Views:
Visualize selection statistics for SNPs across regions using plots like bar charts or line plots.
Display information about the population (e.g., geographical location, sample size).
